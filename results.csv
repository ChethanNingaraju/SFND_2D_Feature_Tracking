Shi-Tomasi,1312,22.23ms,Uniform
Harris,283,24.92ms,fewer points mostly around upper hald
FAST,4870,4.87ms,Extremely dense points

ORB,500,17.36ms,"Scales seemed like a lot of concentric circle, could be duplicate detections"

SIFT,1396,84.541ms,Most consistent detection with good distribution around the bounding box

Recommendation,,,
"The most promising real time keypoint detectors are FAST and ORB. SIFT, AKAZE are extermely time-consuming for realtime application. However, on descritor extractor most of them are withim tolerable limits except for AKAZE and FREAK. SO the most optimal combination considering processing speed and number of features matched are FAST-BRISK, FAST-BRIEF, ORB-BRISK",,,
